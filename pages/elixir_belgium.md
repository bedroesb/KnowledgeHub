## ELIXIR
ELIXIR is an intergovernmental organisation that brings together life science resources from across Europe. These resources include databases, software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.

## Goal
The goal of ELIXIR is to coordinate these resources so that they form a single infrastructure. This infrastructure makes it easier for scientists to find and share data, exchange expertise, and agree on best practices.

## Belgian ELIXIR node
Belgium joined ELIXIR as a full member in November 2015. The Belgian node brings together experience around data management, analyses workflows and data related trainings.
