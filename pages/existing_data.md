## Bibliographic research
Start with a bibliographic research. If you find an interesting publication without any available data, you can contact the authors and request access to their data. If their data are not available or you didn’t find any interesting publication, you can look for existing data in many repositories. 

## Data repositories
Repositories can also contain data that are not linked to any manuscript or “results paper”.
Data repositories can be general, data type specific or discipline specific. To find the repositories that could have data of your interest, you can use the links below:

-	Recommended repositories by European Life sciences Infrastructure for Biological Information: ELIXIR Deposition Databases for Biomolecular Data.
-	List of Recommended Data Repositories by Scientific Data (Nature).
-	List of Recommended Repositories by Springer Nature
-	List of repositories used by Flemish research infrastructures: https://mronocoroni.shinyapps.io/20200325/.
-	Catalogue of databases by FAIRsharing: https://fairsharing.org/databases/.
-	International search engines for academic and scientific research: https://explore.openaire.eu.
-	Registry of Research Data Repositories by Data Cite: https://www.re3data.org.
-	Elsevier offers DataSearch (Beta) to search in a collection of data repositories.
-	Google offers Google Dataset Search or Google Advanced Search.
-	Large institutes such as WHO also collect and provide useful data.

If you want to know how to publish your dataset and get cited for it (not only for your results based on that dataset), see “Data journals (external link)” and “Data submission into repositories(internal link)” paragraphs.
